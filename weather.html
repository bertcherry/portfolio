            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <div>This upcoming project plan will leverage WeatherAPI to guide school students who participate in after school sports on what they'll need to pack for the day.</div>

        <div class="project-section project-audience">
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <div>The primary demographic is school students who participate in after school sports, especially outdoor sports. The survey plan focuses on high schoolers, though further surveys could find ways to increase useability for a younger audience.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section project-details">
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <div>My plan for this project is to begin with a general survey for 10-15 students asking about their use of their phone's weather app. I'll also ask about the basic features proposed for this app, and what elements would feel helpful to them on a 5-point scale.</div>
            <div>I will then integrate student feedback with universal design principles for accessibility to build the weather app.</div>
            <div>Once the app is built, I will return to a smaller subset of the original group to test the app and provide initial impressions from their first user experience in getting the app set up. I will then use their feedback to make improvements and adjustments to the design and features.</div>
