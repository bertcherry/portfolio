            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <div>Ground up build of webpage for two main client groups. First, for prospective members to find services that fit their needs. Then, for active members to enroll in classes and/or access virtual content.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section project-audience">
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <div>There are two typical client types for Strive & Uplift - someone looking for a community gym space, and someone looking for online programming to train for ultimate frisbee. Both groups tend to be interested in a queer-friendly and body-positive training environment. Clients range in age from youth to seniors; some clients are not tech-savvy, while others work in tech themselves.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-section project-details">
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <div>During the 2020 redesign of the website, I took into consideration coach feedback on how they wanted themselves and their services to be represented, as decision making trends toward collective processes.</div>
            <div>Accessibility is a core value for Strive & Uplift, and this extends to the online space. The color themes were chosen based on the established Strive & Uplift logo, conforming with WCAG AAA guidelines for text and interface readability, and A/B tested with the coaches.</div> 
            <div>Mobile useability is a factor, with screen reader friendly options for pricing tables and zoomable images.</div>
            <div>For this site, I built a custom Wordpress theme and accompanying author guides for coaches.</div>
            <div>Direct client feedback and trends in frequently asked questions are taken into consideration for website improvements. Since the rebuild, 25% of new clients say they learned about the business from the website or a Google search.</div> 
            <div>The services page is divided into sections based on what prospective clients are looking for, with subpages for more specific offerings. The class and gym access schedule for the community space are easy to locate for prospective and current clients, featured both on the front page of the site and as a screen reader friendly schedule with sign up options linked in the top navigation menu.</div>
