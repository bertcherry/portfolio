        <div class="project-section project-details">
            <h2>Details</h2>
            <div>The design was created in collaboration with the photographer, with the intent to integrate with their current photo hosting site.</div> 
            <div>We first reviewed other portfolios pages of photographers the client admires. Those portfolios used unobtrusive design elements and greyscale color palettes to let the images speak for themselves.</div> 
            <div>A slideshow of featured images, galleries on specific subject matter, and an easy to locate contact button are the most important elements to connect with clients.</div>
